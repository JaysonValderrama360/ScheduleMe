# Appointment

Throughout your career in software design and development, you will be asked to create applications with various features and functionality based on business requirements. When a new system is developed, typically the process begins with a business analyst gathering and writing these business requirements, with the assistance of subject matter experts from the business. Then a system analyst works with several application team members and others to formulate a solution based on the requirements. As a developer, you would then create a design document from the solution and finally develop the system based on your design document.
